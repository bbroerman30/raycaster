  Ray is a MSDos based raycasting engine similar to Wolfenstein 3D. It allows up to a 64x64 cell map, 
35 textures (256 color 128x128 PCX files), textured floor and ceiling, sprites, 3 types of animated doors, 
20 levels of transparency, translucency, animated textures,lighting and depth cueing (with fog effects), zone maps, and triggers. 

  All of the code here was designed and written by myself after reading many books on the subject.  
The windows port (WinRay) was written in 2000 with some help from Jorge Martin.

  The map file (Map.dat) is a simple text file (and should be easily understood) and the textures are contained in 
simple PCX graphics files (a common file format back in the early 90's). This engine has been ported by others to various 
other formats, and has held up fairly well over time :)
